the process of aggregating data is an integral part of data engineering

### some common techniques for aggregating data:

- Summation/Totaling:
Add up numerical values to get a total. This is common for financial data, sales figures, or any other data where cumulative values are relevant.

- Averaging:
Calculate the average of a set of values. This is useful when dealing with data that represents measurements over a period, such as temperature or test scores.

- Counting:
Count the number of occurrences of a specific event or category. This is often used in categorical data analysis.

- Grouping:
Group data based on certain criteria and then apply aggregation functions within 
each group. This is useful for analyzing data by categories or segments.

- Min and Max Values:
Identify the smallest (min) and largest (max) values in a dataset. This is useful for understanding the range of values.

- Percentiles:
Calculate percentiles to understand the distribution of data. For example, the 25th, 50th, and 75th percentiles provide insights into quartiles.

- Aggregating Time Series Data:
When dealing with time series data, aggregation might involve summarizing data over specific time intervals (e.g., daily, weekly, monthly).

- Weighted Averages:
Assign weights to different data points and calculate a weighted average. This is useful when some data points are more significant than others.

- Concatenation:
Combine text or categorical data from multiple records into a single string or category.

- Aggregating with Pivot Tables:
In spreadsheet software or specialized data analysis tools, pivot tables allow users to aggregate and summarize data interactively.
